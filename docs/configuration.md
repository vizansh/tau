# Configuration and Files

Tau keeps durable application state in the user's home directory and reads
project-local instructions from the active working directory.

## Tau Home

The default Tau home is:

```text
~/.tau/
```

Important files and directories:

```text
~/.tau/providers.json
~/.tau/tui.json
~/.tau/sessions/
~/.tau/skills/
~/.tau/prompts/
~/.tau/AGENTS.md
```

Tau also reads user-level `.agents` resources:

```text
~/.agents/skills/
~/.agents/prompts/
~/.agents/AGENTS.md
```

## Provider Settings

Provider metadata is stored in:

```text
~/.tau/providers.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "local",
  "providers": [
    {
      "name": "local",
      "type": "openai-compatible",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
      "api_key_env": "LOCAL_API_KEY",
      "models": ["qwen", "llama"],
      "default_model": "qwen",
      "headers": {
        "X-Provider-Header": "value"
      },
      "timeout_seconds": 120,
      "max_retries": 2,
      "max_retry_delay_seconds": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```

API keys are not written to this file. Built-in providers added through
`/login` read their key from `~/.tau/credentials.json` using `credential_name`.
Providers without a `credential_name`, such as custom local providers, read the
environment variable named by `api_key_env`. `timeout_seconds` is optional and
defaults to `60`; when present, it must be greater than zero. `max_retries`
defaults to `0`, and `max_retry_delay_seconds` defaults to `1`; both must be
zero or greater. `headers` is optional and must be an object with string keys
and string values. Tau sends these headers with provider requests, while keeping
its own authentication headers under runtime control.

For example, Hugging Face organization billing can be configured with:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "X-HF-Bill-To": "my-org"
  }
}
```

Useful commands:

```bash
tau providers
tau --provider local --model qwen --timeout-seconds 120 --max-retries 2 setup
```

Inside the TUI:

```text
/model
/model qwen
/login
```

## TUI Settings

The built-in Textual frontend reads optional settings from:

```text
~/.tau/tui.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "theme": "high-contrast",
  "keybindings": {
    "cancel": "escape",
    "command_palette": "ctrl+j",
    "session_picker": "ctrl+o",
    "accept_completion": "f2",
    "completion_next": "down",
    "completion_previous": "up",
    "quit": "ctrl+d"
  }
}
```

The built-in themes are:

- `tau-dark`, the default Toad-inspired dark theme with subtle left-accent
  conversation rows.
- `high-contrast`, a sharper dark theme for brighter terminal contrast.

The built-in sidebar is responsive: Tau shows it on medium or larger terminal
windows and hides it automatically when the terminal is narrow or short.

Any omitted keybinding uses the built-in default. Key names use Textual's key
syntax, such as `ctrl+k`, `tab`, `down`, `up`, and `f2`. Tau rejects unknown
themes, unknown keybinding names, empty keys, and duplicate assignments so
mistakes fail early instead of silently changing terminal behavior.

## Sessions

Tau stores sessions under:

```text
~/.tau/sessions/
```

Each working directory gets a readable, hash-stabilized subdirectory:

```text
~/.tau/sessions/<cleaned-path-suffix>-<short-hash>/
```

For example, `/Users/alejandro/repos/exploration/tau` becomes a name like
`home-repos-exploration-tau-a1b2c3`.

Session transcripts are append-only JSONL files. They preserve messages, model
changes, and the active leaf in the session tree. Session metadata is indexed in
the project subdirectory so interactive resume flows can focus on the current
working directory.

Useful commands:

```bash
tau sessions
tau --resume <session-id>
tau --new-session
```

Inside the TUI:

```text
/resume
/status
```

## Skills and Prompt Templates

Tau loads markdown skills from these locations in increasing precedence order:

```text
~/.tau/skills/
~/.agents/skills/
~/.agents/
<cwd>/.tau/skills/
<cwd>/.agents/skills/
<cwd>/.agents/
```

Prompt templates are loaded from:

```text
~/.tau/prompts/
~/.agents/prompts/
<cwd>/.tau/prompts/
<cwd>/.agents/prompts/
```

Project resources override user resources with the same name. Duplicate or
overridden resources are reported through diagnostics instead of preventing Tau
from starting.

Useful TUI commands:

```text
/skills
/resources
/skill:<name> [request]
```

## Project Context

Tau discovers instruction files and includes them in the generated system
prompt. The current discovery order is:

```text
~/.tau/AGENTS.md
~/.agents/AGENTS.md
<project root>/AGENTS.md
<project root>/.../<cwd>/AGENTS.md
<cwd>/.tau/AGENTS.md
<cwd>/.agents/AGENTS.md
```

The project root is the nearest ancestor containing a marker such as `.git`,
`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `setup.py`, or `package.json`.

Useful TUI commands:

```text
/context
/reload
```

## Context Management

`/status` shows a rough context-size estimate:

```text
Estimated context tokens: <count>
Context token breakdown: system=<count>, messages=<count>, tools=<count>
```

Manual compaction is available inside the TUI:

```text
/compact <summary>
```

Tau can also compact automatically before a new TUI turn when the estimated
context exceeds an opt-in threshold:

```bash
tau --auto-compact-threshold 100000
```

Automatic compaction currently uses a deterministic extractive summary of prior
messages. It does not call a model to generate the summary yet.
