# Phase 24: Session Tree Branching

This phase exposes Tau's existing append-only session tree in the Textual TUI.
It follows Pi's core behavior: moving through the tree is a structural session
mutation, not a transcript edit.

## What Changed

`/tree` opens a modal tree picker for the active session. The picker lists
branchable conversation entries near their parent branch point, with small
indentation only where the session history has diverged into alternate branches,
marks the active leaf, and supports two actions:

- `Enter` moves the active leaf to the selected entry.
- `S` moves the active leaf through a new `branch_summary` entry.
- `Ctrl+T` toggles tool-call entries on or off for easier navigation in
  tool-heavy histories.

Both actions preserve all existing JSONL entries. Tau records navigation by
appending a new `leaf` entry, so reopening the session restores the selected
branch. The picker intentionally hides metadata entries such as model changes,
thinking-level changes, leaf pointers, and session info; it only shows user
messages, assistant messages, tool calls, compaction summaries, and branch
summaries.

## Branch Summaries

Tau already had a `BranchSummaryEntry` type. This phase makes it replay-aware:
when the active root-to-leaf path contains a branch summary, `SessionState`
converts it into a user-context summary message.

The first implementation uses the same deterministic summary helper as automatic
compaction to summarize active-path messages after the selected entry. That keeps
the feature self-contained and testable. A later phase can replace this with a
model-generated summary flow without changing the storage shape.

## Boundaries

`tau_agent.session` owns generic replay semantics for `branch_summary` entries.
`tau_coding.CodingSession` owns branch navigation, summary creation, storage
mutation, and harness message replacement. The Textual TUI only displays choices
and calls the session method selected by the user.

## Validation

Useful checks:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_session.py tests/test_coding_session.py tests/test_commands.py tests/test_tui_app.py -q
uv run ruff check src/tau_agent/session/memory.py src/tau_coding/session.py src/tau_coding/commands.py src/tau_coding/tui/app.py tests/test_session.py tests/test_coding_session.py tests/test_commands.py tests/test_tui_app.py
```
